Website Analytics Dashboard Redesign

From “The Big Book of Dashboards” — Reimagined for Deeper Insight & Interactivity

Project Overview

This project is a redesign of the Website Analytics Dashboard from The Big Book of Dashboards. While the original dashboard provided a solid high-level overview of website performance, it lacked analytical depth, interactivity, and visual clarity.

My goal was to transform it into a more insightful, interactive, and visually cohesive dashboard that enables users to explore traffic patterns, geographic trends, and engagement metrics at multiple levels of detail.

This redesign focuses on improving:

Analytical depth beyond surface-level metrics

User-driven exploration through interactivity

Visual hierarchy and storytelling

Original Dashboard: What Worked & What Didn’t
What Worked Well

The original dashboard established important context and baseline metrics:

Date range context helped frame the analysis

Key KPIs (Total Page Views, Total Users) gave a quick sense of scale

Most Visited Topics bar chart was simple and effective

Geographic distribution attempted to show global reach

These strengths formed the foundation of my redesign.

Limitations Identified

Despite its strengths, the original dashboard had several shortcomings:

Mostly a bird’s-eye view with limited analytical depth

Poor visual hierarchy due to layout, colors, and gridlines

Cluttered geographic visualization using empty circles

Limited interactivity, making exploration difficult

Some visuals (e.g., weekday page views) felt forced and low-value

Redesign Objectives

The redesign aimed to:

Enable deeper analysis of users, page views, and engagement

Improve visual clarity and narrative flow

Introduce interactivity without overwhelming the user

Replace low-value charts with more meaningful insights

Create a dashboard suitable for real-world stakeholder use

Key Design & Structural Changes
Dashboard Structure

Redesigned layout using container-based organization for better readability

Clear separation between KPIs, geographic insights, and trend analysis

Added a Show/Hide filter panel to reduce clutter while preserving flexibility

Limited the number of visible charts using sheet swaps, allowing depth without overcrowding

Analytical Enhancements & New Visualizations
1. Density Map – Page Views by Country

Replaced the cluttered symbol map from the original dashboard

Highlights regions with high traffic concentration

Provides an intuitive, high-level geographic overview

2. Pareto Chart – Users by Country

Dual-axis Pareto chart showing:

User count by country

Cumulative contribution to total users

Helps identify top contributing countries and the long tail

3. User Trend Line – Top 5 Countries

Line chart tracking user growth over time for the top 5 countries

Includes a trend line to highlight gradual growth

Enables comparison of regional growth patterns

4. Page Views Comparison – Top 5 Countries

Bar chart showing page view volume

Allows direct comparison of traffic contribution between countries

5. Symbol Map – Average Session Duration

Uses size encoding to represent engagement levels

Adds an engagement perspective beyond traffic volume

Interactivity Features

Map-as-filter: Selecting a country filters all other charts

Synchronized country filter across visuals

Sheet swapping using parameters to toggle between chart views

Date range slider retained from the original dashboard for temporal context

These features allow users to move seamlessly from overview to detail.

Design Improvements

Adopted a neutral, cooler color palette for a professional look

Reduced gridlines and visual noise

Used consistent color encoding across charts

Added trend lines where appropriate to highlight patterns

Balanced insight density with visual simplicity

Explored but Excluded Visuals

To maintain focus and clarity, some visuals were intentionally excluded:

Scatter plot: Page Views vs. Avg. Session Duration (kept as reference)

Sankey diagram: Country → City user flow (insufficient data density)

Forecasting: Removed due to short time series and unreliable predictions

Key Insights Delivered

A small number of countries contribute the majority of users and page views

User engagement (session duration) varies significantly by region

Top countries show steady growth over time, indicating consistent audience expansion

Geographic filtering reveals region-specific performance patterns

Future Improvements

For a larger-scale project, this could be expanded into:

Global Overview Dashboard

High-level KPIs, geographic distribution, and growth trends

Regional Deep-Dive Dashboard

Country/city-level engagement, content performance, and user behavior

Tools & Skills Demonstrated

Tableau: Parameters, calculated fields, sheet swapping, map-based filtering

Dashboard Design: Visual hierarchy, storytelling, UX

Analytics Thinking: Metric selection, chart justification, insight generation

Data Visualization Best Practices
